# Questions to discuss

## Scope

- What is the BIDS mission? 

## Funding

- What is the right upper limit on funding?


## Journals

- Thoughts on only funding fully OA publications? 

One thing that comes up in OA is that many people don't know about
self-archiving or think it is illegal --- especially for students and those out
of academia. Having the right to post the preprint on UC's repository or our
personal websites is one thing, but that's not super accessible. There are also
lots of structures and incentives for researchers to circulate the official DOI
instead of the URL to a self-archived preprint. So lots of people land on the
official paywalled page, then just give up when they see the paywall. I've
received many requests from non-academics asking me for a copy of a non-OA
publication that I have already archived on my own website. Perhaps add:

  - Exception for journals that the UC Library does not subscribe to,
    at the time of publication.
  - Exception if a primary intended audience of the publication includes
    people not in universities (e.g. open source software developers).
  - I'm also okay with the amount being halfed for non-fully OA publications,
    to up to $1250.

JM:  I added some text explaining that UC authors are required to provide
postprints of all published work to eScholarship.

I am opposed to providing funding for non-OA publications.
It isn't clear to me why we should use BIDS funds to promote non-open work.
I am not sure I understand what the exception would be for?

- Predatory OA publishers

There are some predatory OA journals that don't actually do peer review, are
named very similar to high-profile journals, etc., and we'd want to be wary of
funding that. Possibly exclude publishers on [Beall's list of predatory
publishers](https://beallslist.weebly.com/). Or require a short statement about
the publication's scope, history, and impact, with pointers to [this rubric for
identifying predatory
publishers](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=librarian_pubs).
I don't want to make this too involved, especially because these things differ
across fields, but at the very least I think we should put people on guard for
predatory publishers.

JM:  I am not comfortable using Beall's list.
I haven't reviewed his current methodology, but in the past his list sometimes
seemed more personal preference than an exact science.
I prefer the short statement approach over the blacklist. 

## Authors

- Should BIDS fund OA articles if the BIDS fellow is a minor author?
  (first author doesn't apply in all fields)

## Adding BIDS funding in acknowledgements

- BIDS junior Fellows should already be listing BIDS funding in the Acknowledgement section. 
  Perhaps there should be some clarifying language in the policy to say that junior Fellows
  should already be acknowledging the fellowship funding?

JM:  I attempted to address this issue:
