# Questions to discuss

## Scope

- What is the BIDS mission? 

## Funding

- What is the right upper limit on funding?


## Journals

- Thoughts on only funding fully OA publications? 

  One thing that comes up in OA is that many people don't know about self-archiving or think it is illegal --- especially for students and those out of academia. Having the right to post the preprint on UC's repository or our personal websites is one thing, but that's not super accessible. There are also lots of structures and incentives for researchers to circulate the official DOI instead of the URL to a self-archived preprint. So lots of people land on the official paywalled page, then just give up when they see the paywall. I've received many requests from non-academics asking me for a copy of a non-OA publication that I have already archived on my own website. Perhaps add:

  - Exception for journals that the UC Library does not subscribe to, at the time of publication.
  - Exception if a primary intended audience of the publication includes people not in universities (e.g. open source software developers).
  - I'm also okay with the amount being halfed for non-fully OA publications, to up to $1250.

- Predatory OA publishers

  There are some predatory OA journals that don't actually do peer review, are named very similar to high-profile journals, etc., and we'd want to be wary of funding that. Possibly exclude publishers on [Beall's list of predatory publishers](https://beallslist.weebly.com/). Or require a short statement about the publication's scope, history, and impact, with pointers to [this rubric for identifying predatory publishers](http://digitalcommons.lmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1041&context=librarian_pubs). I don't want to make this too involved, especially because these things differ across fields, but at the very least I think we should put people on guard for predatory publishers.

## Authors

- Should BIDS fund OA articles if the BIDS fellow is a minor author?  (first author doesn't apply in all fields)

## Adding BIDS funding in acknowledgements

- BIDS junior Fellows should already be listing BIDS funding in the Acknowledgement section. 
  Perhaps there should be some clarifying language in the policy to say that junior Fellows
  should already be acknowledging the fellowship funding?
