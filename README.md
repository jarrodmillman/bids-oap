BIDS should provide limited funds for open access publishing for its junior fellows
and staff for BIDS-related publications.

Grant funded research should be published using grant money.

## Eligibility

  scholarly book accepted for publication, and does not have other sources of
  funds to pay author processing charges.
- Article, chapter, or scholarly book must pertain to BIDS mission.

## Restrictions 

- Fees will be subsidized only for fully open access journals or books (that
  is, the entire journal or book must be freely available to the public without
  a subscription or access fee).
- BIDS will fund up to $2,500 in fees.
- Each eligible individual may receive this funding no more than one time per
  calendar year.
