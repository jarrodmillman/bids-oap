# BIDS Open Access Policy

BIDS should provide limited funds for open access publishing for its junior fellows
and staff for BIDS-related publications.

Grant funded research should be published using grant money.

## Eligibility

- Any BIDS junior fellow or staff who has an open access article, chapter, or
  scholarly book accepted for publication, and does not have other sources of
  funds to pay author processing charges.
- Article, chapter, or scholarly book must pertain to BIDS mission.

## Restrictions 

- Fees will be subsidized only for fully open access journals or books (that
  is, the entire journal or book must be freely available to the public without
  a subscription or access fee).
- BIDS will fund up to $2,500 in fees.
- Each eligible individual may receive this funding no more than one time per
  calendar year.

## Attribution

We ask that funding recipients include the following statement in their acknowledgments: 

    This publication is funded [in full] [in part] by the Gordon and Betty
    Moore Foundation through Grant GBMF3834 and by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
    through Grant 2013-10-27 to the University of California, Berkeley.

as well as list the Berkeley Institute for Data Science as affiliation.
All BIDS fellows are required to include the above acknowledgment regardless
of whether BIDS covers the OA publishing fee.
